What does it do?

This extension adds button to the Chrome's toolbar that opens a tab with TYPO3 Backend of current site (base href-based),
or a Frontend, if detects it is in Backend.
Also, it provides configuration for various work environments (contexts) to fast jump between them.
It displays info badge on each one to easy recognize on which one you are.
Additionally, you can add some project-related links (like, to task manager) to the context menu (displayed only on that project).
Project configuration may be exported to share with your team.

Note, that you may disable all environment-related functionality, to use only BE/FE switching and keep the ext lightweight.

Switching to Frontend opens last selected page in backend page tree (works similar as View webpage button in backend,
but works even if currently some module without page tree /or such button/ is open).
(tested in versions 6.2, 7.6 and 8.7. any between should work as well)

Story:

Some time ago there was an extension for switching to backend, but it was only opening current domain + /typo3/ segment - I've used it
for a long time though. Thanks to the author of original ext, Patrick Lischka, for inspirations to improve this idea.

- My ext goes further and it can open back the Frontend from Backend, also it can not only add a path to a domain, but
tries to extract the <base> tag from a page source, then uses it for a backend url (or just a domain, if not found).
So it works as expected when running TYPO3 project in subdirectory, ie. on your dev environment.
(For this, it needs that you set <base href="[url]"> in <head>)


Please write me any problems, suggestions or ideas.

FAQ:

Q: I have a multi-domain site. And when I'm in Backend I use switch to get to Frontend.
 Why am I getting an error "ID was outside the domain"?

A: You probably have selected a page in the tree which is in a root that uses different domain than current
 domain in url used for getting the Backend.
 You must select a page within the root that contains current domain or disable the "Open current pagetree selected page"
 in extension options.


Q: Couldn't it detect proper domain for selected page?

A: No. It's impossible to retrieve such information from Backend using Chrome's extension.


Q: I'm on some page id in Frontend, and when I use the button to open Backend, I'm getting the "About modules" screen.
 Could it detect that page id and expand the tree for me?

A: It would be great, but as far as I know it's not possible to make Backend preselect a page in tree from any
 external call. I'll try some workaround in future, but it will need a special TYPO3 extension just for that.


Q: Why there's suddenly a "project-name" submenu in icon context menu, and my envs goes there, instead to be in top-level?

A: This is because of Chrome's stupid limit of items (6) in this menu - and you've added more. So to show them all,
 they must go into submenu - submenus doesn't have limits, but are less comfortable. So consider reducing number of
 env contexts and/or links. Sorry - blame Google.
