## Manifest3 update TODO:

- fix action button - doesn't work when switching BE -> FE

	//- action button menu is not generating (while the right-click menu works well) DONE?

- finally do the backend switching with opening current page uid (taken from body class/id etc.)
	/typo3/module/web/layout?id=54

- find traces of "custom backend url / path" function which was never finished, and try to make it work
	(someone asked of possibility to set completely different domain for backend, but at least we need
	to be able to set custom "typo3" (per project or globally? depends what will be possible)
	this way it can be finally used with other cms

- backend favicon is broken again (it makes overlay from empty) - compare with one of 2.2.5xx versions where it worked but some fix broke it
